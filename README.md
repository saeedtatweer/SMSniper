SMSniper
=====================

SMSniper is a forked version of the Bouncer SMS Filter [repository](https://github.com/afterxleep/Bouncer). It is a simple SMS filtering app for iOS that uses the `ILMessageFilterExtension` to move unwanted and specific messages to the "Junk", "Promotion", "Transaction" and other pre-defined sections of the Messages app.

Our plan for SMSniper is to add new features and improvements and continue its development independently.

Like Bouncer, SMSniper does not share, upload or send any of your personal information or SMS messages to a remote server. All the filtering happens locally on your phone.

Unlike other SMS filtering apps, Bouncer does not share, upload, or send any of your personal information or SMS messages to a remote server. All filtering processes occur locally on your phone, ensuring data privacy and security.

## Customize Your Messaging Experience

Bouncer checks messages against a user-defined blacklist, providing a personalized and clutter-free messaging experience.
